title: Add availability-recovery from systematic chunks

doc:
  - audience: Node Operator
    description: |
      Implements https://github.com/pezkuwi-fellows/RFCs/pull/47. This optimisation is guarded by a configuration bit in
      the runtime and will only be enabled once a supermajority of the validators have upgraded to this version.
      It's strongly advised to upgrade to this version.

      Implements https://github.com/pezkuwi-fellows/RFCs/pull/47 and adds the logic for availability recovery from systematic chunks.
      The /req_chunk/1 req-response protocol is now considered deprecated in favour of /req_chunk/2. Systematic recovery is guarded
      by a configuration bit in the runtime (bit with index 2 of the node_features field from the HostConfiguration)
      and must not be enabled until all (or almost all) validators have upgraded to the node version that includes
      this PR.
