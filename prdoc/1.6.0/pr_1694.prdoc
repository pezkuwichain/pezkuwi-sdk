title: Agile Coretime Base Relaychain Functionality

doc:
  - audience: Runtime User
    description: |
      The relay chain is now capable of receiving assignments from the coretime
      chain and will schedule parachains and on-demand orders accordingly.
      Existing leases and system chains are preserved. They get a reserved
      coretime core via a migration.

      description: |
        Claim queue in scheduler now no longer contains Option values and
        assignments now contain information necessary to accomodate for coretime
        features. Also all existing parachains are converted to coretime
        assignments.
