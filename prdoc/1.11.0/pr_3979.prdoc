title: Deprecate `para_id()` from `CoreState` in pezkuwi primitives

doc:
  - audience: "Node Dev"
    description: |
     `CoreState`'s `para_id()` function is getting deprecated in favour of direct usage of the
     `ClaimQueue`. This is the preferred approach because it provides a better view on what is
     scheduled on each core.
