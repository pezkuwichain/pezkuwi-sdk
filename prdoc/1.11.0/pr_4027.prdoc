title: Add `candidates_pending_availability` Runtime API

doc:
  - audience: "Node Dev"
    description: |
     This new API retrieves all `CommittedCandidateReceipts` of all candidates pending availability
     for a parachain at a given relay chain block number. It is required by collators that make use
     of elastic scaling capability in the context of PoV recovery and block import. The old API 
     `candidate_pending_availability` is now deprectated and will be removed in the future.
