title: "Integrate litep2p into Pezkuwi SDK"

doc:
  - audience: Node Dev
    description: |
      litep2p is a libp2p-compatible P2P networking library. It supports all of the features of rust-libp2p
      that are currently being utilized by Pezkuwi SDK and is a drop-in replacement for any node operator.

      For node developers, introduction of litep2p implies specifying the networking backend that Pezkuwi SDK
      shall use for P2P networking. A new trait called `NetworkBackend` is introduced which is implemented
      by both the libp2p and litep2p backends and which is used to initialize any networking-related code.

  - audience: Node Operator
    description: |
      litep2p is considered experimental and rust-libp2p will remain as the default networking backend
      for Pezkuwi SDK but litep2p can be selected with `--network-backend litep2p`.
