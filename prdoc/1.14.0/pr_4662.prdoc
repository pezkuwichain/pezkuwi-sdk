title: Cleanup PVF artifact by cache limit and stale time

doc:
  - audience: Node Operator
    description: |
      Extend the PVF artifacts cleanup strategy. Previously, we pruned artifacts that were stale more than 24 hours.
      After this change we attempt pruning artifacts only when they reach the 10 GB cache limit. If the least used
      artifact is stale less than 24 hours we don't remove it.
