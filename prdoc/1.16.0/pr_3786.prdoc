    description: |
      Implemetation of https://github.com/pezkuwi-fellows/RFCs/pull/91, to use `creation_time` field to determine
      the newest DHT record and to update nodes known to have the old record.

      Gossip-support is modified to try to re-resolve new address authorithies every 5 minutes instead of each session,
      so that we pick autorithies that changed their address faster and try to connect to them.
