title: OmniNode --dev flag starts node with manual seal 

doc:
  - audience: [ Runtime Dev, Node Dev ] 
    description: |
      `pezkuwi-omni-node` lib supports `--dev` flag now by allowing also to pass over a chain spec,
      and starts the node with manual seal. It will seal the node at each `dev_block_time` milliseconds,
      which can be set via `--dev-block-time`, and if not set will default to `3000ms`.
