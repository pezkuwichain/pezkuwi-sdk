title: Make importing of duplicate assignment idempotent

doc:
  - audience: Node Dev
    description: |
      Normally, approval-voting wouldn't receive duplicate assignments because approval-distribution makes
      sure of it, however in the situation where we restart we might receive the same assignment again and
      since approval-voting already persisted it we will end up inserting it twice in ApprovalEntry.tranches.assignments 
      because that's an array. Fix this by inserting only assignments that are not duplicate.
