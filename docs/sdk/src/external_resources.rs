//! # External Resources
//!
//! A non-exhaustive, un-opinionated list of external resources about Pezkuwi SDK.
//!
//! Unlike [`crate::guides`], or [`crate::pezkuwi_sdk::templates`] that contain material directly
//! maintained in the `pezkuwi-sdk` repository, the list of resources here are maintained by
//! third-parties, and are therefore subject to more variability. Any further resources may be added
//! by opening a pull request to the `pezkuwi-sdk` repository.
